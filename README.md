##Installation

###Prerequisites
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Bower](https://bower.io/)
- PHP

###Install dev locally
1. Clone the repo

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Set the two following variables to match your credentials.

   ```
   USERNAME="jim@demo.nutshell.com"
   KEY="43c789d483fd76547b1f157e3cf5e580b95b9d8c"
   ```

3. Run `composer install` to get PHP dependencies

4. Run `npm install && bower install` to install front-end dependencies


### Running locally

1. In the project directory run `cd app && php -S localhost:8080` to start back-end part
2. In the root of the project directory run `gulp serve` to run front-end

##Notes
- Back-end part is serving all data on purpose so it can be used in other projects or in other purposes as well
- Asumes that you cast the URL to a chromecast
- Only quering the first 100 accounts, default value can be changed [here](https://github.com/simondahla/nutshell-dashboard/blob/master/app/data.php#L14) or by passing a query parameter with the request `?limit=500`

##2do
- [ ] Add back-end error handling
- [ ] Add JS error handling
- [ ] Add notifications so the user gets notified when the dashboard is auto-updated and when there is new data
- [ ] Add Security layer so the dashboard is not available with out a secret/key
- [ ] Clean up the data that is served (from back-end) and stored in front-end
